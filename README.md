## Features

 > Taking inspiration from games like Overcooked and Papa’s ___eria, the monsters order food and the player must try to fulfill them as fast as possible before the timer ends using the different stations in the kitchen. Orders will come into the child's notebook and correlate with certain monsters. The player must reach a minimum number of orders by the end of the timer. However, the parent will randomly come downstairs to check up on the kitchen, as well as clean up any ingredients found on the counters. Therefore, the player must juggle satisfying the monsters’ orders while also hiding themself and the food from the parent.

| <a target="_blank"> At the Fridge Station the player is able to get an unlimited amount of ingredients. They can carry them two at a time with one item per hand. From there ingredients must be placed in the correct work stations. </a> | <a  target="_blank"> Ingredients must be loaded into the sandwich or smoothie station in order to be used. To build an order, click on the corresponding ingredient to the side. Ingredients and unfinished sandwiches left in the station will be put back in the fridge if the parent walks over to it. </a> | <a  target="_blank"> The trashcan is a source of ingredients similar to the fridge, except more specialized for monster ingredients. </a> |
    
### The Parents
- **Hallway Light**
    - The hallway lights will flash on before a parent comes to warn you to hide.
- **Clean Up**
    - The parents will walk around the room. They will clean up every station and everything set on a counter, putting everything back in the fridge. If they see the child, the night ends. The player does NOT need to sit out the parents in a hiding spot the entire time the parents are patrolling the kitchen. The player can also try to avoid the parents by being behind them or simply staying out of view. Hiding with the food can save them time as they wouldn’t have to remake it.

    
### The Monsters & Orders
 - **Notebook Features**
    - The Notebook is where all of the orders will appear. You will know there is a new order when a new monster’s head appears at the window with a corresponding sound. Within the notebook you will see the image of the monster at the window and their desired order below it. An order will say “Sandwich” or “Smoothie” followed by the list of ingredients and how many of each.
- **Monster in Window**
    - The Monsters will stick their head out of the windows. You must bring their meals to them. If an order is fulfilled correctly, the monster will leave. If you give the monster an incorrect order, the monster will remain and the incorrect order will disappear.
